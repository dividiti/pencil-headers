# PENCIL Header Files
-----------------------
This repository contains two folders:
- include/ : which contains the PENCIL header files.
For instance, it contains the pencil.h file that you should include
in your PENCIL programs.
- pencil_headers_generator/: which contains the PENCIL header files
generator, it is the C++ program that was used to generate some of the PENCIL
header files (Math functions).
Note that the header files generated from the PENCIL header generator
are different from the headers in include/ as the later are modified
by hand after being generated.
