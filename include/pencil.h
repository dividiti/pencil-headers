/* There are 2 ways to use PENCIL file:
 *
 * 1. As Normal C file:
 *    - All PENCIL specific functions (like __pencil_assert) must be ignored.
 *    - All PENCIL built-in functions (math functions, for example) must be
 *      implemented.
 *
 * 2. As PENCIL file supplied to the PENCIL compiler:
 *    - All PENCIL specific functions must be preserved.
 *    - All PENCIL build-in function must be declared (to make the front-end
 *      happy), but not implemented.
